# Hyperspectral Data Metrics

This script calculates **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)** and **Shannon Entropy** for each spectral band in a hyperspectral datacube.

## Metrics

- **SNR**: Measures the ratio of signal mean to noise standard deviation for each band.
- **Entropy**: Quantifies the randomness or uncertainty in each band, indicating noise level.
